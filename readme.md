# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's `turtle` module. The game features a snake that grows longer each time it eats food, and the player must avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
  - Up: Move up
  - Down: Move down
  - Left: Move left
  - Right: Move right
- The snake will move continuously in the current direction.
- The goal is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and your score increases.
- The game ends if the snake runs into the wall or into itself.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
